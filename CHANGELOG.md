# CHANGELOG

## Version 1.6.0 - Output Data Cleaning & API Refinement

### ‚úÖ Data Cleaning & API Output Improvements
- The `/api/combined-report/` backend endpoint now:
  - Excludes entries with both "ACCOUNT NAME" and "CAMPAIGN NAME" empty.
  - Excludes entries with both "TOTAL SPEND" and "REVENUE" equal to zero.
  - Removes `"P/L_FORMULA"`, `"ROI_FORMULA"`, and `"ROI_VALUE"` fields from all output objects.
- Output is now cleaner and more relevant for downstream processing and reporting.

## Version 1.5.0 - Application Stability & Final Data Verification

### ‚úÖ Critical Fixes & Stability Improvements
- **Resolved Application Crashes**: Fixed a critical and persistent `AttributeError` that caused the server to crash when fetching data for deactivated or banned Google Ads accounts.
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Removed the complex and faulty error-handling logic that attempted to process deactivated accounts. The system now relies on a more robust and stable approach.
- **Restored `ENABLED` Account Filtering**: The account discovery process now strictly queries for accounts with `status = 'ENABLED'`, preventing API errors and ensuring application stability.

### ‚úÖ Data Integrity & Finalization
- **Verified Data Accuracy**: The final campaign cost report is now stable and has been verified to be correct for all active and accessible accounts.
- **Finalized JSON Output**: The system now reliably produces the exact JSON output required, sorted correctly by Account and Campaign name. Deactivated accounts are now correctly excluded from the final report to ensure stability.

---

## Version 1.4.0 - Google Ads Data Completeness & Finalization

### ‚úÖ Google Ads Data Integrity and Reporting Fixes
- **Recursive Account Discovery**: Implemented a robust, recursive discovery function (`get_all_accounts_in_hierarchy`) to reliably find all client accounts, including those nested under multiple manager levels.
- **Manager Account Filtering**: Fixed critical API errors by intelligently filtering out manager accounts (`is_manager=False`) before requesting campaign metrics, as the API disallows metric queries on manager accounts.
- **Handled Banned Accounts**: Confirmed that the system correctly excludes banned or disabled accounts (e.g., "Polar Cooling") from discovery, ensuring the final report only contains active, billable accounts.
- **Finalized JSON Output**: Adjusted the campaign cost report to exactly match the user's required format, including `Account`, `CustomerID` (with hyphens), `Campaign`, `Currency`, and `Cost`.
- **Production-Ready Logging**: Replaced all temporary `print` statements with structured `logging` for better error tracking and maintainability.

## Version 1.3.1 - Frontend OAuth & Dual-Callback Integration

### ‚úÖ Google OAuth (Dual Callback) and Next.js Integration
- Integrated Google OAuth dual-callback flow: both backend and frontend can handle OAuth redirects.
- Next.js frontend now supports Google login and authorization callback at `/auth/google-callback`.
- All four required endpoints are now available and fully working in both backend and frontend:
  * /api/auth/google/
  * /api/auth/google/callback/
  * /api/report/generate/
  * /api/google-ads/test/
- Google account can be authorized from either Django or React/Next.js UI.

### üöß Known Issues / Pending
- Google Ads ‚Äúleaf‚Äù/client account data is still returning cost = 0 for all campaigns. **(Root cause: Developer token is Basic Access; must wait for Google Standard Access approval.)**
- Full multi-account MCC reporting is blocked until Standard Access is granted.
- All removed backend functions and files (merged report, email, Google Sheets, etc.) will be restored after Google approves Standard Access for the developer token.

---

## Updated Daily Task List

- [x] Connect Google OAuth from both backend and frontend (dual-callback) ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement working React/Next.js pages for all required endpoints ‚úÖ
- [x] Match backend and frontend OAuth redirect URIs (localhost only, per Google policy) ‚úÖ
- [x] Confirm Binom reporting works in the UI ‚úÖ
- [x] Confirm Google Ads campaign data loads in the UI (cost=0 with Basic Access) ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Wait for Google Ads API Standard Access approval for real cross-account data** ‚è≥
- [ ] Restore merged report, Sheets, and email endpoints after approval
- [ ] (Optional) Improve frontend UI/UX, add dashboard and navigation
- [ ] Document setup for new devs

---

**Once Google Standard Access is approved, full multi-client Google Ads data will be available, and you can re-enable advanced backend features.**


## Version 1.3.0 - Minimal Backend Refactor for Google/Binom Reporting

### ‚úÖ Temporary Cleanup for Core Endpoints Only
- **Removed**: All unused files and functions related to merged reports, Google Sheets, and email sending.
- **Exposed Only**: Four required endpoints:
  * /api/auth/google/
  * /api/auth/google/callback/
  * /api/report/generate/
  * /api/google-ads/test/
- **Note**: All removed files and functions will be restored after resolving Google API access/permissions issues.

### üõ† Internal Refactoring & Docs
- Updated backend codebase for maximum clarity and maintainability.
- Added detailed docstrings to each API endpoint for internal onboarding.
- Cleaned up all unused URL routes and modules.

---

## Daily Task List (Next Steps)
- [ ] **Implement frontend UI for all 4 endpoints using Next.js + React**
    - Google OAuth login and callback
    - Campaign cost reporting UI (Google Ads test)
    - Binom raw report UI
- [ ] Add loading/error states for all API interactions
- [ ] Write frontend API client hooks
- [ ] Prepare for restoring email, merging, and Google Sheets features after Google API approval
- [ ] QA: Test all endpoints with real data in production-like environment

---

*Once Google Ads API standard access is restored, all removed backend logic will be re-enabled and integrated into the production pipeline.*


## Version 1.2.0 - Binom API Timezone Support & Parity

### ‚úÖ Binom API Timezone Parameter Support
- API now fully supports `timezone` param, matching Binom admin and JS include.
- Accepts both `timezone` and legacy `dateTimeZone` query params (with `timezone` preferred).
- Always passes through the user‚Äôs selected timezone value to Binom as `timezone=...`.
- Output now matches Binom admin and Postman reports exactly, including metrics like revenue and clicks.

### ‚úÖ Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed issue where reporting endpoint silently defaulted to a fallback timezone, causing metric mismatches.
- Added explicit documentation of timezone effect on daily/period revenue totals.
- Backend now enforces a single, user-specified timezone per request for full parity.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Timezone Documentation
- Note: Reporting numbers (revenue, clicks, etc.) will differ depending on the `timezone` used.
- Default timezone is now `America/Atikokan` for consistent agency-wide reporting, unless overridden via API.


## Version 1.1.0 - MCC Google Ads API Full Integration

### ‚úÖ OAuth2 Google Authentication
- Google OAuth2 fully implemented with offline refresh token handling.
- User email extracted via userinfo API.
- Secure storage of tokens in GoogleAccount model.

### ‚úÖ Google Ads API Full Multi-Account Discovery
- Implemented GoogleAdsClient with MCC (Manager Account) support.
- Dynamic discovery of accessible clients under MCC using CustomerService.
- Correctly extract customer IDs from resource names.
- Filtered ENABLED customer accounts only.
- Excluded inactive, suspended, and canceled sub-accounts.
- Fully compatible with Google Ads API v18.

### ‚úÖ Error Handling & Stability Improvements
- Fully resolved gRPC transport issues.
- Stabilized SDK version management (google-ads 22.0.0).
- Corrected ID parsing, query formats, and resource name handling.
- Fully stable GRPC streaming for SearchStream API calls.

### ‚úÖ Development Environment Stabilization
- Locked dependency versions for Windows compatibility.
- grpcio / grpcio-status / google-ads fully version pinned for 2025 standards.
